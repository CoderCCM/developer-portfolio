        title: "Past and Present Methodologies for Instructional Debugging in the Age of Generative AI",
        abstract: "Debugging is often underemphasized or omitted in computer science curricula despite being a critical skill for success in the software development industry. This paper surveys five key studies regarding the process of debugging, how the skill has been taught throughout time, and how generative AI serves as a platform to advance its teaching. Through this analysis, a comprehensive perspective on the reasons why the skill is difficult to teach is developed. It is stated that careful guardrails and foresight must accompany this new technology to ensure that increased independence rather than over reliance is the outcome of its application to education. Finally, future research is proposed and the increasing importance of debugging skills in a world infiltrated by AI-generated code is discussed.",
